## Overview
TeleGiphy is based off the icebreaker game, “Telephone”, where an original message is passed along a chain of players through whispers, and is entertaining through the often very distorted message at the end. TeleGiphy is a spin-off of the game that relies on Giphy’s magnificent random-ness when selecting gifs instead of whispers to distort messages. 

## Purpose/Goals
To create an enjoyable social experience through a simple party game.
To allow for an asynchronous experience in social contexts.
