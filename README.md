# TeleGiphy

## Overview
TeleGiphy is based off the icebreaker game, “Telephone”, where an original message 
is passed along a chain of players through whispers, and is entertaining through 
the often very distorted message at the end. 

TeleGiphy is a spin-off of the game that relies on Giphy’s magnificent random-ness 
when selecting gifs instead of whispers to distort messages. 

## Purpose
To create an enjoyable social experience through a simple party game.

To love Doges across the world ♥
